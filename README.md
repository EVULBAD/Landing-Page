# Odin Project: Landing Page

My first completed Odin Project project! This course taught me about the powers of flexboxes. They didn't teach me about flex in my community college webdev class, and mannnn what a misstep on their part. Positioning with margins was always a losing battle, and if I had known flex was an option, building my old websites would have gone much smoother.

Flex isn't much of a struggle, especially after *not* using it for my webdev career. It is *that* convenient! 

Right now, the page itself isn't particularly interesting; I just wanted to focus on learning flex, so I copied exactly what the Odin Project had down. I may return and make this page into something cooler at some point, but I'm in no rush. It's a stylistic success, and that's all I needed.
